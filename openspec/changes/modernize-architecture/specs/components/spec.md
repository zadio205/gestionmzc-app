## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Component Architecture
Components SHALL follow single-responsibility principle with clear separation of concerns and consistent naming conventions.

#### Scenario: Component composition
- **WHEN** building complex UI features
- **THEN** components are composed from smaller, focused sub-components
- **AND** each component has a single, well-defined responsibility

#### Scenario: Code organization
- **WHEN** organizing component files
- **THEN** consistent naming conventions and directory structure are followed
- **AND** components are logically grouped by feature

## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Component Size Limits
No component SHALL exceed 300 lines of code to maintain readability and testability.

#### Scenario: Component refactoring
- **WHEN** component exceeds size limits
- **THEN** component is refactored into smaller, focused components
- **AND** functionality is preserved while improving maintainability

### Requirement: Lazy Loading Implementation
Heavy components SHALL implement lazy loading to improve initial application performance.

#### Scenario: Component lazy loading
- **WHEN** component is not immediately visible or needed
- **THEN** component is loaded on-demand using React.lazy()
- **AND** loading states provide good user experience

### Requirement: Error Boundary Coverage
All major component sections SHALL be wrapped in error boundaries for graceful error handling.

#### Scenario: Component error handling
- **WHEN** component encounters runtime errors
- **THEN** error boundary catches and displays appropriate fallback UI
- **AND** errors are logged for debugging purposes
