# Text Contrast and Visibility Improvements

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: WCAG AA Compliant Text Contrast
All text elements throughout the application MUST meet WCAG AA contrast standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text) to ensure readability for users with visual impairments.

#### Scenario:
A user with mild visual impairment visits the client management page. All text including headers, labels, and data maintains at least 4.5:1 contrast ratio against backgrounds, making the content readable without strain.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Normal text (14pt+) maintains minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Large text (18pt+) maintains minimum 3:1 contrast ratio
- Interactive elements have enhanced contrast for better visibility
- Text remains readable in all lighting conditions
- Automated contrast testing passes for all text elements

### Requirement: Enhanced Form Field Visibility
Form labels, placeholders, and input text SHALL have improved contrast to ensure users can easily read and interact with form elements across all pages.

#### Scenario:
User fills out the client creation form. Form labels use dark gray-900 text against white backgrounds, input text is clearly visible, and placeholder text is distinguishable but not confused with entered data.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Form labels use high contrast colors (gray-900 or darker)
- Input text maintains strong contrast with backgrounds
- Placeholder text is visible but distinct from entered text
- Error states have clear, high-contrast indicators
- Disabled fields remain readable while indicating disabled state

### Requirement: Navigation and Sidebar Contrast
Navigation elements including sidebar menu items, headers, and navigation links SHALL have improved contrast for better usability and accessibility.

#### Scenario:
User navigates through the admin dashboard. Active menu items have strong contrast with backgrounds, hover states provide clear feedback, and all text is easily readable against the sidebar background.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Active navigation items have strong visual distinction
- Hover states provide clear feedback with good contrast
- Menu text is readable against sidebar background
- Icons and text maintain consistent contrast ratios
- Mobile navigation is touch-friendly with visible targets

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Table Header and Data Contrast
Table headers and data cells SHALL have improved contrast to ensure information is easily scannable and readable, especially in data-heavy dashboard views.

#### Scenario:
User views the client list table. Table headers use high-contrast text for easy scanning, data rows maintain good contrast with subtle alternating colors, and action buttons are clearly visible.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Table headers use high contrast for better scannability
- Row data maintains good contrast with alternating row colors
- Action buttons in tables are clearly visible
- Sort indicators and icons have proper contrast
- Hover states provide clear visual feedback

### Requirement: Button and Interactive Element Contrast
All buttons, links, and interactive elements SHALL have enhanced contrast to ensure they are easily identifiable and accessible, including disabled states.

#### Scenario:
User interacts with various buttons throughout the application. Primary buttons have strong contrast, secondary buttons are visible but don't compete, and disabled buttons show their state while remaining readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Primary buttons have strong contrast with backgrounds
- Secondary buttons maintain visibility without competing
- Disabled buttons show clear disabled state while remaining readable
- Link text is underlined or has distinct styling
- Focus states meet accessibility standards

### Requirement: Modal and Overlay Text Visibility
Text within modals, tooltips, and overlay elements MUST maintain excellent contrast against backdrop colors to ensure readability in all contexts.

#### Scenario:
User opens a client details modal. The modal title, content, and close button all maintain high contrast against the backdrop, making all text easily readable without eye strain.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Modal titles and content have high contrast
- Backdrop opacity doesn't interfere with text readability
- Tooltip text is clear and legible
- Close buttons and controls are easily visible
- Error and success messages have appropriate contrast

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Low-Contrast Gray Text Variants
Remove low-contrast gray text variants (gray-400, gray-500 on light backgrounds) that fail accessibility standards and cause readability issues.

#### Scenario:
Previously, some secondary text used gray-400 on white backgrounds, making it difficult to read. These instances are replaced with higher contrast alternatives or removed entirely.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- No gray-400 text on white or light backgrounds
- Gray-500 used only for decorative elements, not functional text
- All functional text meets minimum contrast requirements
- Consistent text hierarchy with appropriate contrast levels
- Better visual hierarchy through contrast rather than just color
