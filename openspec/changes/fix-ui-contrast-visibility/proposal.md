# Fix Black Screens and Invisible Text Issues

## Problem Summary
Users are experiencing black screen displays and invisible text throughout the application, making it difficult to use the platform effectively. These issues appear to be related to:

1. **Loading states with black overlays** that don't properly clear
2. **Poor text contrast** especially with gray text on light backgrounds
3. **Missing fallbacks** during authentication and data loading states
4. **Inconsistent dark mode handling** causing text to disappear

## Impact
- Users cannot see important information during page transitions
- Authentication flows may appear broken with black screens
- Reduced accessibility for users with visual impairments
- Poor user experience leading to frustration and potential abandonment

## Solution Overview
This change will:
1. Fix loading overlays and black screen issues
2. Improve text contrast ratios throughout the application
3. Add proper loading states and fallbacks
4. Ensure consistent visibility across all UI components
5. Implement better error state handling
