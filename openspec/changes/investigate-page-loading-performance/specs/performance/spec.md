## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Fast Page Loading
The system SHALL load pages within 3 seconds for authenticated users and 2 seconds for public pages.

#### Scenario: Dashboard loading performance
- **WHEN** an authenticated user accesses their dashboard
- **THEN** the page SHALL be interactive within 3 seconds
- **AND** critical content SHALL be visible within 2 seconds

#### Scenario: Auth flow performance
- **WHEN** a user navigates between protected routes
- **THEN** the middleware SHALL complete authentication checks within 500ms
- **AND** users SHALL not see blank pages for more than 1 second

### Requirement: Progressive Loading
The system SHALL implement progressive loading to show content incrementally rather than waiting for all data.

#### Scenario: Dashboard progressive loading
- **WHEN** loading the admin dashboard
- **THEN** layout and navigation SHALL appear immediately
- **AND** statistics SHALL load within 1 second
- **AND** secondary content SHALL load progressively

#### Scenario: Error state handling
- **WHEN** data loading fails
- **THEN** the system SHALL show appropriate error states
- **AND** SHALL NOT leave users on blank screens

### Requirement: Optimized Authentication
The system SHALL minimize authentication overhead through caching and efficient data fetching.

#### Scenario: Cached user profiles
- **WHEN** a user navigates between pages
- **THEN** their profile data SHALL be cached for 5 minutes
- **AND** SHALL not trigger database queries on every request

#### Scenario: Middleware optimization
- **WHEN** the middleware processes requests
- **THEN** it SHALL use cached role information when available
- **AND** SHALL minimize database round trips

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: User Authentication Flow
The authentication system SHALL provide fast, reliable user session management with appropriate loading states.

#### Scenario: Session initialization
- **WHEN** the application loads
- **THEN** user session SHALL be verified within 1 second
- **AND** loading states SHALL be shown during verification
- **AND** fallback to metadata SHALL be immediate if database is slow

#### Scenario: Role-based access
- **WHEN** checking user permissions
- **THEN** role verification SHALL use cached data when possible
- **AND** SHALL not block page rendering unnecessarily

### Requirement: Dashboard Data Loading
Dashboard components SHALL load data efficiently with proper error handling and loading indicators.

#### Scenario: Initial dashboard load
- **WHEN** users access their dashboard
- **THEN** critical metrics SHALL load first
- **AND** secondary data SHALL load in parallel
- **AND** artificial delays SHALL be eliminated

#### Scenario: Data refresh
- **WHEN** refreshing dashboard data
- **THEN** only changed data SHALL be refetched
- **AND** UI SHALL remain responsive during updates
