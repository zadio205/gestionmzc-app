## REMOVED Requirements
### Requirement: Debug Components in Production
**Reason**: Debug components should not be present in production code as they serve only development purposes and can expose sensitive information or create confusion.

**Migration**: Remove debug components and their imports from production code. Debug functionality can be recreated in development environment when needed.

#### Scenario: Debug component removal
- **WHEN** reviewing production codebase
- **THEN** no debug components SHALL be present in src/components/debug/
- **AND** no imports of debug components SHALL exist in production pages

#### Scenario: Development testing needs
- **WHEN** developers need debug functionality
- **THEN** they SHALL create temporary debug components in development environment
- **AND** SHALL NOT commit them to the main codebase

## REMOVED Requirements
### Requirement: Backup Configuration Files
**Reason**: Backup configuration files from previous versions are redundant since version control provides complete history. They create confusion and maintenance overhead.

**Migration**: Remove all backup configuration files. Historical versions can be accessed through git history if needed.

#### Scenario: Configuration file cleanup
- **WHEN** examining root directory
- **THEN** no backup configuration files SHALL exist (e.g., package-v3-backup.json)
- **AND** only current configuration files SHALL be present

#### Scenario: Historical configuration access
- **WHEN** needing previous configuration versions
- **THEN** developers SHALL use git history to access old versions
- **AND** SHALL NOT rely on backup files in the repository

## REMOVED Requirements
### Requirement: Standalone Test HTML Files
**Reason**: Standalone HTML test files are not part of the Next.js application structure and should be moved to proper testing frameworks or removed.

**Migration**: Remove standalone HTML test files. Testing should be done through proper testing frameworks integrated with the application.

#### Scenario: Test file removal
- **WHEN** reviewing project structure
- **THEN** no standalone HTML test files SHALL exist in root directory
- **AND** all testing SHALL be done through proper test frameworks

## REMOVED Requirements
### Requirement: Outdated Documentation Files
**Reason**: Multiple outdated documentation files create confusion and maintenance overhead. Essential documentation should be consolidated and kept up-to-date.

**Migration**: Remove outdated documentation files and consolidate essential information into core documentation files.

#### Scenario: Documentation cleanup
- **WHEN** reviewing documentation
- **THEN** only current and essential documentation SHALL remain
- **AND** outdated bug fix reports and temporary guides SHALL be removed

#### Scenario: Essential documentation preservation
- **WHEN** removing documentation files
- **THEN** README.md and AGENTS.md SHALL be preserved
- **AND** any critical setup information SHALL be consolidated
