## Context
The project has accumulated several unnecessary files during development including debug components, backup configuration files, test HTML files, and outdated documentation. These files serve no purpose in the production application and create maintenance overhead, confusion for new developers, and clutter in the codebase.

## Goals / Non-Goals
- Goals: Clean up the codebase by removing truly unused files, improve project organization, reduce maintenance overhead
- Non-Goals: Remove any files that might be needed, break existing functionality, remove documentation that is still valuable

## Decisions
- Decision: Remove debug components that are only used for development testing
- Rationale: These components should not be in production code and can be recreated if needed
- Alternatives considered: Keep them in a separate debug folder, move to examples directory
- Decision: Remove backup configuration files from previous versions
- Rationale: Version control provides history; backup files are redundant
- Alternatives considered: Archive them in a separate folder, keep for reference

## Risks / Trade-offs
- Risk: Accidentally removing files that are actually needed
- Mitigation: Careful analysis of file usage, check imports and references
- Risk: Losing historical context or documentation
- Mitigation: Keep essential documentation, archive important historical info
- Trade-off: Cleaner codebase vs losing potentially useful reference material

## Migration Plan
1. Analyze each file to confirm it's truly unused
2. Remove debug components and update imports
3. Delete backup configuration files
4. Remove test HTML files
5. Clean up outdated documentation
6. Test that application builds and runs correctly
7. Commit changes with clear description of removed files

## Open Questions
- Should we create an archive branch for the removed files?
- Are there any documentation files that should be preserved for historical context?
