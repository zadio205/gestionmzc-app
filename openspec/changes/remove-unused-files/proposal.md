## Why
The project contains several unnecessary files that clutter the codebase and create confusion. These include debug components, backup configuration files, test HTML files, and outdated documentation that are no longer needed in the production application. Removing these files will improve code organization, reduce maintenance overhead, and create a cleaner project structure.

## What Changes
- Remove debug components that are only used for testing and development
- Delete backup configuration files from previous versions
- Remove standalone test HTML files
- Clean up outdated documentation files that are superseded
- Remove unused cache and service files that are no longer referenced

## Impact
- Affected specs: file-management
- Affected code: Debug components, backup files, test files, outdated documentation
- Dependencies: None - this is a cleanup operation that removes unused code
