# Optimize Bundle Performance

**Status**: Proposed  
**Priority**: High  
**Created**: 2025-10-13  
**Updated**: 2025-10-13

## Problem Statement

The application has significant performance issues affecting user experience:

1. **Large Bundle Size**: Admin pages are 189KB, causing slow initial loads
2. **No Code Splitting**: All code loads upfront, even unused features
3. **Heavy Dependencies**: Large packages imported in their entirety (e.g., Recharts, date-fns)
4. **Unoptimized Assets**: No image optimization or lazy loading strategy
5. **No Performance Monitoring**: Zero visibility into bundle composition and bottlenecks

### Impact

- **User Experience**: Slow page loads, especially on mobile/slow connections
- **Bandwidth Costs**: Unnecessary data transfer for unused features
- **SEO**: Poor Core Web Vitals scores
- **Scalability**: Bundle size will grow as features are added

### Current Metrics

- Bundle size: ~189KB (admin pages)
- Time to Interactive: Unknown (no monitoring)
- Total dependencies: 566MB node_modules
- Code splitting: None implemented
- Image optimization: None

## Proposed Solution

Implement comprehensive performance optimization strategy:

### 1. Bundle Analysis & Monitoring

- Install and configure `@next/bundle-analyzer`
- Set up performance budgets in Next.js config
- Add bundle size tracking to CI/CD
- Implement runtime performance monitoring

### 2. Code Splitting & Dynamic Imports

- Split route-specific code using Next.js dynamic imports
- Lazy load modal components and heavy UI elements
- Defer non-critical third-party scripts
- Implement route-based code splitting

### 3. Package Optimization

- Replace heavy packages with lighter alternatives
- Use tree-shakeable imports (import specific functions)
- Remove duplicate dependencies
- Implement package size auditing

### 4. Asset Optimization

- Use Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
- Implement lazy loading for images and charts
- Compress and optimize static assets
- Add responsive image loading

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Bundle size reduced to <100KB per route
- [ ] Time to Interactive <2s on 3G connections
- [ ] All routes use code splitting
- [ ] Performance budgets enforced in CI
- [ ] Core Web Vitals scores in "Good" range
- [ ] Package audit script in place

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Analysis (Days 1-2)

1. Install bundle analyzer
2. Generate bundle reports for all routes
3. Identify largest dependencies
4. Document optimization opportunities
5. Set performance budgets

### Phase 2: Quick Wins (Days 3-4)

1. Implement tree-shakeable imports
2. Add dynamic imports for modals
3. Lazy load charts and heavy components
4. Optimize Next.js config

### Phase 3: Deep Optimization (Days 5-7)

1. Replace heavy dependencies
2. Implement aggressive code splitting
3. Optimize images with Next.js Image
4. Add performance monitoring

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Enforcement (Day 8)

1. Set up CI bundle size checks
2. Add performance budgets
3. Document optimization guidelines
4. Create performance dashboard

## Dependencies

- Must complete after security improvements (logging before monitoring)
- Should coordinate with architecture restructuring
- Requires build pipeline updates

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Dynamic imports break features | High | Thorough testing, error boundaries |
| Performance budgets too strict | Medium | Start conservative, adjust iteratively |
| Build time increases | Low | Optimize analyzer runs, cache builds |
| Package replacements introduce bugs | High | Incremental migration, full test coverage |

## Testing Strategy

- Load testing with various network conditions
- Visual regression testing for lazy-loaded components
- Bundle size snapshot testing
- Lighthouse CI integration
- Manual testing on low-end devices
