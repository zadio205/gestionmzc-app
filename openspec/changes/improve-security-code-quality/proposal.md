# Improve Security and Code Quality

## Why

The application currently has critical security and code quality issues that pose risks to production stability and data security:
- 348 console.log statements exposing sensitive data in production
- ESLint validation disabled during builds allowing errors to reach production
- No error boundaries causing complete app crashes on component failures
- No structured logging system for production debugging

## What Changes

- **BREAKING**: Remove all console.log/console.error statements from production code
- Implement structured logging system with environment-aware output
- Enable ESLint validation during production builds
- Add comprehensive error boundaries at critical application boundaries
- Create production-safe debugging utilities

## Impact

**Affected specs:**
- `logging` (new capability)
- `error-handling` (new capability)
- `build-quality` (new capability)

**Affected code:**
- 61 files with console statements across src/
- next.config.ts (ESLint configuration)
- All page components (error boundary wrapping)
- API routes (error handling)

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates security risk of leaking sensitive data
- Provides structured logging for production debugging
- Prevents build-time errors from reaching production
- Improves user experience with graceful error recovery
- Enables better monitoring and observability
